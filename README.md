# WERP climate adaptation toolkit

## Purpose
Development of the WERP climate adaptation toolkit, to ingest hydrological scenarios representing historical or future climates or adaptation options, and process those through various response models (currently [MDBA EWR tool](https://github.com/MDBAuth/EWR_tool), with intention to include other tools in future). Subsequent processing of outcomes along spatial, theme, and temporal axes are available, as well as control over outputs and comparisons between scenarios. Causal networks defining relationships in the response models are included.

## Use
Still in development, will have several options for running, including purely scripted and step-by-step with user control over each aspect of the analysis and aggregation.

### Developement
