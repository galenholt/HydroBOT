Significant velocities now only occur at high flows, when the weir has been removed. This has made conditions less favourable for species that depend on fast flowing water, such as Murray Cod and Murray Crayfish. The weir has reduced scouring and promoted sedimentation upstream of the weir, which has reduced habitat diversity. The watercourses in the Euston Lakes Floodplain are subject to sedimentation and dense vegetation growth as a result of shallow stable water levels. While Washpen Creek provides important habitat for Freshwater Catfish and a diverse frog population, the habitat has the potential to deteriorate without periodic scouring flows. High river discharges, exceeding 50,000 ML/d, are required to create through-flow in floodplain watercourses including Caringay Creek and Washpen Creek. Weir manipulation provides opportunities to improve watercourse habitat. Raising and lowering water levels on a seasonal basis would create a more diverse and broader riparian vegetation community, would help suppress emergent plant growth in deeper channel areas and would promote diversity in biofilm communities. Lowering Lock 15 while river discharge is elevated has been proposed to improve riverine habitat (see Section 7.4). Lowering the weir would reduce the extent of the weir pool and would temporarily increase channel velocities and sediment mobilisation. The ecological benefits and risks of this measure need to be explored before a recommendation can be made. It is unlikely that a temporary increase in velocity is sufficient to sustain local populations of Murray Crayfish but it may contribute to the habitat requirements of Murray Cod."
